## üß† Context & Applications

Introversion and extroversion influence how individuals socialize, recharge, and respond to external stimuli. This dataset replicates personality-linked behaviors such as:

- Time spent alone
- Frequency of attending social events
- Social media posting habits
- Feeling drained after socializing

**Useful for:**
- Psychology & behavioral science research  
- Marketing & audience segmentation  
- Human-computer interaction (HCI) design  
- Personality classification datasets for ML model development
